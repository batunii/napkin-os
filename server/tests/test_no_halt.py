"""No stage halts a job (the owner, 2026-09-30: "no stage should halt a brief or
Research being produced, that's the worst thing we can do").

Every way a start_campaign or draft_brief job used to stall or stop — a stage
that raises, one the model refuses or answers malformed, one that outlives its
time, a change the host refuses, no poll bringing the earlier stages, a
question nobody answers — now degrades to a recorded gap, and the job ends
`done` with what it has. The campaign job is driven directly with the fakes and
a small host that applies each reply's change (and refuses what a test says).
