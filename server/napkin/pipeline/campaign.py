"""The start_campaign job: six stages, one job (middleware-api.md §8, M1).

extract -> identify -> select -> research -> synthesise -> report

A background worker runs the stages in order. Each stage's output is a
"chunk" (patch, read-set, pins, findings, decisions, and the agent message
that narrates it), computed ONCE and cached, so a repeat is byte-identical and
carries the same decision ids. Every reply carries the chunks whose decisions
the request's `clan.decision_chain` does not hold yet (§8.4).

identify may stop the job at `needs_input` with a question; the worker waits
until `answer_question` is accepted. The report stage waits until a poll
brings a document holding every earlier stage's decisions, and composes from
that document (§8.4).

No stage halts the job (the owner, 2026-09-30: "no stage should halt a brief
or Research being produced"). A stage that raises, that the model refuses or
answers malformed, or that outlives its time is a recorded gap — a decision
and a chat message naming the stage and why, with what the job does without
it — and the next stage runs. A question nobody answers within QUESTION_WAIT
goes on with a stated default (never a guessed brand). A change the host keeps
refusing is dropped after REFUSED_AFTER polls, so what follows it can land,
and its stage becomes a gap. The report stage waits at most REPORT_WAIT for a
poll bringing the earlier stages, then composes from the job's own copy. The
job always ends `done`, with a report, or with the reason there is none.
