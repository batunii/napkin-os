"""The Napkin middleware: `napkin.middleware/1` (docs/contracts/middleware-api.md).

The middleware holds the logic — stage orchestration, the identify rules,
tiering, derived confidence, the per-market merge, contests, the cite rule,
Brief Maker's capture, drafters and Judge — and talks to four peripherals
through ports (docs/contracts/peripherals.md): the model (Anthropic Messages
or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint), research, retrieval and the knowledge
layers (all HTTP). Which implementation sits behind each port is
configuration only.
