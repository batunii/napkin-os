# mock-backend

Napkin's one mock backend: a single process that fakes every peripheral the
middleware talks to, answering the generative ones with headless Claude Code.
The spec is `docs/contracts/peripherals.md` (contract 5) and
`docs/contracts/peripherals/*.schema.json`; §5 is this process.

```sh
python3 mock-backend/server.py          # http://127.0.0.1:8797
```

The middleware points each port at it by URL and at the real service the same
way. Nothing else changes (§0.1):

```sh
NAPKIN_MODEL_API=anthropic NAPKIN_MODEL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797    NAPKIN_MODEL_API_KEY=dummy
NAPKIN_MODEL_API=openai    NAPKIN_MODEL_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797/v1 NAPKIN_MODEL_API_KEY=dummy
NAPKIN_RESEARCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797
NAPKIN_RETRIEVAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797
NAPKIN_LAYERS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797
```

Python 3.11+, **standard library only**: no dependency to justify. The
Claude-backed families need `claude` on `PATH`, signed in. The process refuses
to start without it unless `MOCK_FAKES=layers`.

It holds **no middleware logic**: no tiering, confidence, merge, reasoning or
judging. Peripherals store, search, fetch and generate. The only checks it
makes are its own honesty checks: research URLs and quote shapes, and
retrieval quotes verbatim in the pack file.

It replaces `mock-llm/` (:8791) and `mock-research/` (:8792). Both were
retired once their tests were ported here.

## Routes

| Family | Route | Answered by |
|---|---|---|
| model | `POST /v1/messages` | one `claude -p`, Anthropic Messages shape (§1.3) |
| model | `POST /v1/chat/completions` | one `claude -p`, OpenAI-compatible shape with `response_format` `json_schema` (the NIM wire, §1.4) |
| model | `GET /v1/models` | the id map: Anthropic list shape when the request has `anthropic-version`, OpenAI list shape otherwise |
| research | `POST /v1/research` | one `claude -p` with WebSearch + WebFetch (§2) |
| retrieval | `GET /v1/packs`, `POST /v1/retrieve` | the pack files + one `claude -p` that picks and quotes (§3.6) |
| layers | `/v1/layers/…` (every route in §4.3) | SQLite, no model (§4.8) |
| — | `GET /healthz` | what it fakes (§5.5) |
| — | `/v1/embeddings`, anything else | `404` |

`MOCK_FAKES` (default `model,research,retrieval,layers`) chooses which
families are served. A family that is switched off answers `404`, and is
absent from `/healthz`. This lets a real peripheral replace one family while
the mock serves the rest.

## Claude underneath

Every call is **one fresh subprocess**, never `--resume`. It runs in an empty
temporary directory under `<MOCK_DATA>/work` with these flags:
`--no-session-persistence --setting-sources "" --strict-mcp-config
--disable-slash-commands`. The prompt goes on stdin. A system prompt (model
and retrieval calls) goes through a pipe fd (`--system-prompt-file
/dev/fd/N`), so it is never on argv and never on disk. Research sends no
system prompt: it keeps Claude Code's own, which drives its WebSearch and
WebFetch tool use, as `mock-research` did. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are removed from
the child's environment. One semaphore of `MOCK_CONCURRENCY` subprocesses is
shared by all families.

### Model

- **Ids** (§1.5):

  | Model id | Alias |
  |---|---|
  | `claude-opus-5` | `opus` |
  | `claude-opus-5-5` | `claude-opus-5-5` (full id) |
  | `claude-sonnet-5-5` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` (full id) |
  | `claude-sonnet-5` | `sonnet` |
  | `claude-haiku-4-5` | `haiku` |
  | `claude-fable-5-1` | `fable` |

  `MOCK_MODEL_ALIASES` (a JSON object `{"<id>": "<alias>"}`) adds more ids. It
  replaces the default list, which maps these NIM ids:

  | NIM id | Alias |
  |---|---|
  | `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1` | `sonnet` |
  | `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct` | `sonnet` |
  | `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-vl-8b-v1` | `haiku` |

  Any other id is a `404` in the wire's shape: `not_found_error` for
  Anthropic, `model_not_found` for OpenAI. It never falls back to a default.
  The response echoes the requested id.
- **Translation.** One user turn is passed through verbatim. A multi-turn
  history (the port's retry turn) is flattened into a `<user>…</user>` /
  `<assistant>…</assistant>` transcript. The call's `schema` goes to
  `--json-schema`. The envelope's `structured_output`, serialised, becomes the
  reply text. `effort` becomes `--effort` (Anthropic wire only).
  `stop_reason` is always `end_turn` and `finish_reason` always `stop`.
- **Images: supported.** Anthropic `image` blocks (`source.type: base64`) and
  OpenAI `image_url` parts (`data:<type>;base64,…`) are accepted. The bytes go
  to the CLI as image content blocks through `--input-format stream-json
  --output-format stream-json --verbose`. We verified that Claude Code 2.1.281
  reads them: the `NAPKIN 42` PNG in `contract/png_text.py` came back as
  `NAPKIN 42` on both wires (contract open point O6: the mock's half is
  answered yes).

  Accepted: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif` and `image/webp`, up to
  5 MB decoded per image and 20 images per call, in user turns only.

  Refused: a remote image URL. The bytes are client-confidential and must not
  be fetched from a link.
- **Usage** comes from the CLI envelope and is never estimated. Anthropic
  `input_tokens` is fresh + cache-creation + cache-read tokens as the CLI
  reports them. The `cache_*` fields are always 0. OpenAI `prompt_tokens` and
  `completion_tokens` use the same numbers.
- **Accepted and ignored** (the CLI has no flag for them):

  | Wire | Fields |
  |---|---|
  | Anthropic | `temperature top_p top_k stop_sequences metadata thinking service_tier cache_control` |
  | OpenAI | `temperature top_p seed user chat_template_kwargs nvext frequency_penalty presence_penalty stop max_completion_tokens stream_options parallel_tool_calls service_tier metadata store reasoning_effort` |

  Other unknown OpenAI fields are ignored too, because the contract refuses
  unknown fields only on the Anthropic wire.
- **Refused with `400 invalid_request_error`**, because dropping them silently
  would pass in development and fail in production:
  - on both wires:
    - `tools`, `tool_choice`, `functions`, `function_call` and `mcp_servers`;
    - tool blocks and tool messages;
    - `stream: true`;
    - an assistant-last prefill;
    - document, audio or file content;
  - on the OpenAI wire:
    - `n > 1`;
    - `logprobs`;
    - a `response_format` other than `json_schema`;
    - a system message after the first user message;
  - on the Anthropic wire, an unknown top-level field.
- **CLI failures:**

  | CLI result | Anthropic wire | OpenAI wire |
  |---|---|---|
  | not logged in | `401` | `401` |
  | `api_error_status` 404, 429 or 529 | that status | that status; 529 becomes `503 overloaded` |
  | anything else, or no JSON | `500 api_error` | `500 server_error` |
  | a run past the timeout | `504` | `504` |
  | no free slot within the queue timeout | `529 overloaded_error` | `503 {type: server_error, code: overloaded}` |

- **Never cached.** Two identical requests may differ, as they do on the real
  API.

### Research

`mock-research`'s behaviour, with contract 5's tidy-ups:

- **Request checks:** `query` is 1–500 characters. `market` is uppercased, and
  `UK` is refused (the UK is `GB`). `entity` and `category` must match their
  patterns. `max_sources` is 1–20 (default 8). Any other field is `400
  invalid_input`.
- **What comes back:** sources and verbatim excerpts only. URLs are
  normalised and deduped. There are 1–5 quotes per source, each at most 1,500
  characters. `retrieved_at` is set by the service. `published_at` is absent
  when unknown or in the future. `sources: []` is an honest 200.
- **Failures:** a CLI failure is `502 upstream_failed`, and a run past the
  timeout is `504 timeout`. Neither is cached.
- **Cache:** `<MOCK_DATA>/cache/research/<sha256>.json`, keyed by the
  normalised request, the model and a prompt version. It holds the query
  parameters (a public-web question, never material text) and public
  excerpts. `?fresh=1` or `MOCK_NO_CACHE=1` skips reading it.

### Retrieval

- **Packs** are directories under `BRIEF_CORPUS` when that is set, else under
  `MOCK_PACKS_DIR` (default `engine/packs_dist`). They are discovered as
  `engine/packs.py` does:
  - the directory name is the pack id;
  - a `_`-prefixed directory is switched off;
  - `pack.yaml` sets the tag, `kind`, `k`, `loops` and `licence`.

  A pack without `pack.yaml` takes its tag, `k` and `loops` from
  `engine/rag/packs.lock`, so the digests answer to the tags the real index
  uses (`template`, `cannes`, `dandad`, `ipa`, `playbook`).

  A pack with a `.digest_state.json` is `kind: digest`. A house pack is
  `licensed-internal` unless `pack.yaml` says otherwise.

  `MOCK_AGENCY_PACKS_DIR/<org slug>/<pack>/` adds agency packs, owned by
  `org/<org slug>` (S6). They are listed and searchable only under that
  `X-Napkin-Org`. For any other org they are `404 unknown_pack`, never 403.
- **Sections** come from every `.md` file, split at H1/H2 exactly as
  `rag.split_h2` splits it (a test compares the two). They are filtered by
  `where`, an exact match on frontmatter metadata. `filterable` is the set of
  frontmatter keys the pack's files carry, and the digests carry none. With
  no `packs` named, `where` must be filterable in every visible pack.
- **Selection.** When the candidates fit `MOCK_RETRIEVAL_MAX_CHARS` they all
  go to Claude. Otherwise a lexical prefilter (token overlap with the query)
  keeps the best that fit. One `claude -p` (`MOCK_RETRIEVAL_MODEL`) returns
  `{picks: [{section, quote}]}`.
- **Verification.** A quote must be a contiguous span of its section after
  whitespace is collapsed on both sides. The span is returned exactly as it
  stands in the file, markdown included. A quote that is not in the file is
  dropped, and so is a bad index, a second pick from the same section, and
  anything past `k`.

  `id`, `uri` and `text_sha256` follow the §3.2 formula. `score` is
  `1 - (rank-1)/k`. A span over 4,000 characters is cut at a word and marked
  `truncated`.
- **Honest limits.** `engine/packs_dist` holds five digests (three pattern-note
  sections each), not the award corpora, and there is no Effie pack.
  Selection is a model's judgement, not similarity. Determinism comes from
  the cache.
- **Cache:** `<MOCK_DATA>/cache/retrieval/`, keyed by the normalised request,
  the org, the model, a prompt version and every searched pack's version. It
  holds the response only (pack passages). It never holds the query.

### Layers

`server/napkin/layers/local.py` (LocalLayers) moved behind the §4 routes on
SQLite, with no model. The append rule is exactly today's:

| Outcome | When |
|---|---|
| `created` | nothing current for the identity |
| `corroborated` | same value; the new sources are linked |
| `superseded` | another value with a later `as_of` |
| `contested` | another value with an earlier or equal `as_of`, or the request said `contested` |

Versions count per entity + key across markets.

The fixes the contract makes:

- `licence` is **required** on facts and sources, with no default.
- A category-layer fact on an unknown `category/<leaf>` is `400 unknown_leaf`,
  and so is a roster category.
- A `client-confidential` source is visible only to its org. That covers
  `sources(ids)`, a fact row's source links, and the ids an append may cite.
- The append (fact + decision + links + status flips) is one transaction, and
  so is the roster write (every roster fact + the decision + the brand name).
  This settles O3, O4 and P2/M5 as the owner decided.
- `Idempotency-Key` is required on `POST /facts`, `POST /sources` and
  `PUT /roster/{ref}`. A replay within 24 h returns the first response with
  `Idempotent-Replay: true`. The same key with another body is `409`. Keys
  are per org.
- Decisions are stored whole, reasoning included. `GET
  /v1/layers/decisions/{id}` returns one, visible only in the scope it was
  written in.

The taxonomy seed is `docs/contracts/peripherals/taxonomy.json` (18 verticals,
108 leaves plus one provisional leaf). Both the mock and a real layers service
seed from it. `MOCK_LAYERS_DB` sets the file (default
`<MOCK_DATA>/layers.sqlite`); delete it to reset the layers.

**In-process** (for the middleware's unit tests, §8.5):

```python
sys.path.insert(0, "mock-backend")
from layers_port import LayersApp
from common import Request
app = LayersApp(":memory:")          # or a file path
resp = app.handle(Request.build("GET", "/v1/layers/categories", {"X-Napkin-Org": "org/a"}))
resp.status, resp.body, resp.headers
```

This answers exactly as the HTTP routes do, so an `HttpLayers` client can run
over a transport that calls `app.handle` instead of a socket.

## Shared rules

- **Scope** comes only from `X-Napkin-Org: org/<slug>` and `X-Napkin-Brand:
  brand/<slug>`. A scoped route without the header it needs is `400
  missing_scope`. A body naming `scope`, `org`, `org_id`, `tenant`,
  `tenant_id` or `brand_scope` at its top level is `400 invalid_input`.
- **Auth:** with `MOCK_TOKEN` set, every route requires it. Research,
  retrieval, layers and `/healthz` take `Authorization: Bearer`. The model
  routes take their wire's own header (`x-api-key` or Bearer for Anthropic,
  Bearer for OpenAI) and answer `401` in the wire's shape.
- **Errors:** research, retrieval and layers answer `{"error": {"type",
  "message"}}`. The model routes use the wire's own shape. No message
  carries request content. A 200 never carries `error`.
- **Bodies are never written or logged.** The log is one metadata line per
  request: id, method, path, status, duration, `X-Napkin-Handler` and
  `X-Napkin-Job`. Set `MOCK_DUMP_REQUEST_BODIES_TO=<dir>` only to debug one
  request, then delete the directory.
- **Size:** a body over `MOCK_MAX_BODY_BYTES` is discarded unread and answered
  `413`.

## Environment

| Var | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `MOCK_BACKEND_HOST` / `MOCK_BACKEND_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `8797` | refuses 8080, 8090, 8787, 8788, 8790, 8791, 8792, 8795, 8796 |

| `MOCK_RESEARCH_MODEL` / `MOCK_RETRIEVAL_MODEL` | `sonnet` / `sonnet` | CLI aliases |
| `MOCK_RESEARCH_BACKEND` | `claude-code` | `search-jev`: the agent only searches (WebSearch, no WebFetch); code fetches the pages (trafilatura, pypdf) and jev picks the passages (`search_jev.py`; needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and those packages) |
| `MOCK_JEV_SEARCHES` / `MOCK_JEV_CANDIDATES` / `MOCK_JEV_UNIT_CHARS` | `2` / `12` / `4000` | search-jev: searches per unit, pages read per unit, characters of passages kept per unit |
| `MOCK_RETRIEVAL_MAX_CHARS` | `150000` | above this, the lexical prefilter |
| `MOCK_PACKS_DIR` | `engine/packs_dist` | house packs |
| `BRIEF_CORPUS` | unset | the full corpus; replaces `MOCK_PACKS_DIR` |
| `MOCK_AGENCY_PACKS_DIR` | unset | `<org slug>/<pack>/` agency packs |

## Tests

```sh
# Unit and server tests against a fake claude: no network, no Claude spend (~15 s).
python3 -m unittest discover -s mock-backend/tests -v

# The contract suites (§8), stdlib only, run unchanged against the mock or a real service.
python3 mock-backend/contract/layers_contract.py    --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8797
python3 mock-backend/contract/retrieval_contract.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8797 --org org/dev-agency
python3 mock-backend/contract/research_contract.py  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8797 [--no-live]
python3 mock-backend/contract/model_contract.py     --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8797    --api anthropic --expect-refusals
python3 mock-backend/contract/model_contract.py     --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8797/v1 --api openai    --expect-refusals

# All of them, a URL per port (each defaults to --base-url):
python3 mock-backend/contract/run_all.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8797 --no-live --expect-refusals
python3 mock-backend/contract/run_all.py --layers-url https://layers.internal --layers-token T --only layers

# The official SDKs with only the environment changed (live, tiny):
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=dummy \
  uv run --no-project --with anthropic python mock-backend/tests/sdk_test.py anthropic
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8797/v1 OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy \
  uv run --no-project --with openai python mock-backend/tests/sdk_test.py openai

# The middleware must not know the mock exists (§0.1):
sh mock-backend/tests/removability.sh
```

`--no-live` skips every check that makes a model or search call. The layers
suite never makes one.

### Live sample (2026-09-24, Claude Code 2.1.281)

| Suite | Result | Time | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| model, anthropic wire | 14/14 | text 2.8 s, strict schema 4.8 s, retry turn 7.8 s, image 4.2 s | `claude-haiku-4-5` → haiku |
| model, openai wire | 14/14 | text 2.8 s, strict schema 5.1 s, retry turn 7.7 s, image 3.9 s | `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-vl-8b-v1` → haiku |
| retrieval | 34/34 | two retrieves over the five digests (15 sections), 17.3 s and 8.2 s, $0.048 and $0.031 | sonnet |
| layers | 77/77 | under a second | none |
| research | 32/32 | BMW EV market in IE, `max_sources` 3: 97.7 s and $0.42 for three sources (BMW Group Ireland, SIMI, CSO) with 3–4 quotes each; the repeat was a cache hit in 0.00 s | sonnet + WebSearch/WebFetch |

The two SDK checks passed as well: anthropic 1.4.0 and openai 3.19.2.

## Divergences from the real services

- **Model:**
  - `max_tokens` is checked after the reply, not during it: when the answer
    turn the CLI reports (hidden thinking included) wrote more than
    `max_tokens`, the reply is cut to the same share of its text and
    `stop_reason` is `max_tokens` (`finish_reason` `length` on the OpenAI
    wire). Usage still reports what the CLI actually wrote. A run with extra
    dev-only turns (the CLI's broken-JSON retry) is not checked, since its
    total spans more than one answer. Otherwise `stop_reason` is `end_turn`.
  - There is no prompt caching.
  - Token counts include Claude Code's own framing and structured-output
    tool, so they are not a cost number.
  - Structured output is the CLI's `--json-schema` validation, not
    constrained decoding.
  - Multi-turn history is a flattened transcript.
  - Latency is not production latency. Never tune `NAPKIN_MODEL_TIMEOUT` to
    the mock.
- **Research:**
  - Quotes are not re-verified against the page (the middleware checks
    figures).
  - Results are not deterministic across cache misses.
  - The cache never expires.
- **Retrieval:**
  - There are no embeddings; `embed_model` is `null`.
  - Selection is a model's judgement.
  - Against `packs_dist` the passages are digest notes, not award cases.
- **Layers:** SQLite with one connection and one lock, not Postgres with RLS.
  The observable behaviour is the contract's.
